## What is this?
Multiplayer Minor Gambling (MMG) is the best (and only?) online multiplayer gambling game where you and your friends can recklessly throw fake money at fake slot machines and other questionable casino games. 

No real money involved. No real stakes. Just pure degeneracy and virtual financial ruin.  

It’s like Vegas, but:
- Online  
- No age restrictions (but I won’t tell your parents)  
- No real consequences (unless you rage quit)

## Features
- Online Slot Machines – Watch the reels spin as your life savings disappear into the void.  
- Future Minigames – Maybe roulette? Maybe blackjack? Maybe an NFT Ponzi scheme? *(Just kidding. Or am I?)*  
- Leaderboard – See who’s the richest among your broke friends. Bragging rights included.  
- Multiplayer Madness – Move around, talk to friends, and collectively make bad financial decisions.  
- Money Particle Explosions – Because nothing says "winner" like cash raining from the sky.  
- No Microtransactions – Because your mom’s credit card deserves a break.

## Disclamer
This game is 100% satire. No real money is used. No actual minors should be gambling (seriously).<br>
Please don't sue me.
